# 🏥 Epidemic Big Data Pipeline  
### Scalable Spark & Scala Platform for Epidemiological Analytics

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **production-grade Big Data pipeline** for large-scale **epidemiological data processing**, built with **Apache Spark (Scala)** and designed using **modern data engineering best practices**.

The pipeline ingests **public epidemic data from REST APIs**, applies **data quality controls**, performs **advanced analytics and machine learning**, and exports curated datasets into a **Hadoop-compatible Data Lake**, making them directly exploitable by **data analysts, data scientists, and BI tools**.

This repository is intentionally designed as a **real-world reference architecture**, not a toy or tutorial project.

## 🎯 Business & Public Health Use Case

The platform addresses **epidemic monitoring and decision support**, enabling:

- Tracking confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and trends
- Country-level and continent-level analysis
- Reliable datasets for dashboards and reporting
- Feature engineering and ML-based analytics
- Demonstration of Big Data technologies in public health contexts

Typical datasets may include:
- COVID-19
- Dengue
- Cholera
- Influenza
- Other globally reported epidemic indicators
